# Action Plan (Prioritized)
1. **Mitigate GitHub Takeover Risk** — **High severity** vulnerabilities detected across multiple hosts indicate potential for unauthorized access to GitHub repositories. Immediate action is required to prevent account takeover. — **Evidence**: Detected on `https://mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com`, `https://mta-sts.hackerone.com`, and `https://mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com` with extracted results pointing to `hacker0x01.github.io`.

2. **Implement WAF Rules** — Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to block requests that could exploit the GitHub takeover vulnerability. This will help in preventing automated attacks while a more permanent fix is being developed. — **Evidence**: All three hosts returned a `404 Not Found` response, indicating potential misconfiguration or exposure.

3. **Review DNS Settings** — Ensure that DNS settings for the affected domains are correctly configured to prevent unauthorized access. This includes verifying that no subdomains are pointing to untrusted or inactive GitHub pages. — **Evidence**: The takeover detection indicates that the domains could be misconfigured, allowing for potential takeover.

4. **Conduct a Security Audit** — Perform a comprehensive security audit of the affected domains to identify any other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could lead to further security risks. — **Evidence**: The repeated detection of the same vulnerability across multiple hosts suggests systemic issues that need addressing.

5. **Educate Development Teams** — Provide training to development teams on secure coding practices and the importance of maintaining proper configurations for GitHub repositories and associated services. — **Evidence**: The existence of these vulnerabilities indicates a lack of awareness or oversight in managing GitHub integrations.
