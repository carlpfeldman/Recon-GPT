# Action Plan (Prioritized)
1. **Mitigate GitHub Takeover Risk on mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com** — This host is vulnerable to a GitHub takeover, allowing an attacker to potentially claim the domain if it is not properly configured. — **Evidence:** Detected 404 response indicating no valid GitHub Pages content, matched at `https://mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com`.

2. **Mitigate GitHub Takeover Risk on mta-sts.hackerone.com** — Similar to the previous host, this domain is also at risk of a GitHub takeover. Immediate action is required to prevent unauthorized access. — **Evidence:** Detected 404 response indicating no valid GitHub Pages content, matched at `https://mta-sts.hackerone.com`.

3. **Mitigate GitHub Takeover Risk on mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com** — This host is also vulnerable to a GitHub takeover, posing the same risks as the others. — **Evidence:** Detected 404 response indicating no valid GitHub Pages content, matched at `https://mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com`.

# Vulnerability Summary
- **GitHub Takeover** — **Hosts:** mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com, mta-sts.hackerone.com, mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com — **Template-IDs:** github-takeover — **Severity:** High

### Next Steps:
- **Immediate Action:** Review the DNS settings and ensure that the domains are correctly configured with valid GitHub Pages content or remove the domains if they are not in use.
- **Long-term Mitigation:** Implement monitoring for any unauthorized changes to the DNS records and consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block potential takeover attempts.
- **False Positive Risk:** Ensure that the domains are indeed intended for GitHub Pages and not misconfigured; verify that the 404 responses are legitimate and not indicative of a different issue.
