# Action Plan (Prioritized)
1. **Mitigate GitHub Takeover Risk** — **High Severity** — Multiple hosts (e.g., `https://mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com`, `https://mta-sts.hackerone.com`, `https://mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com`) are vulnerable to GitHub takeover due to 404 responses indicating that the site is not configured correctly. This allows potential attackers to claim the domain. Immediate action is required to prevent unauthorized access. 
   - **Next Steps**: 
     - Verify that the GitHub Pages are correctly configured with the necessary files (e.g., `index.html`).
     - Ensure that the DNS settings are correctly pointing to the intended GitHub repository.
     - Review and update any relevant documentation to prevent future misconfigurations.
