# Action Plan (Prioritized)
1. **Mitigate GitHub Takeover Risk on HackerOne Subdomains** — **High severity** vulnerabilities detected across multiple subdomains indicate a potential for account takeover. Immediate action is required to secure these domains. — **Evidence:** 
   - **Host:** `mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com` — **URL:** `https://mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com` — **Template-ID:** `github-takeover`
   - **Host:** `mta-sts.hackerone.com` — **URL:** `https://mta-sts.hackerone.com` — **Template-ID:** `github-takeover`
   - **Host:** `mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com` — **URL:** `https://mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com` — **Template-ID:** `github-takeover`
   - **Extracted Results:** `hacker0x01.github.io` indicates a potential takeover target.

2. **Implement Domain Verification** — Ensure that all subdomains are properly configured with DNS records and that ownership is verified to prevent unauthorized access. — **Evidence:** The 404 responses indicate that the expected content is not present, which could allow an attacker to claim the domain.

3. **Review and Update Security Policies** — Review existing security policies related to domain management and ensure that they are enforced across all subdomains. — **Evidence:** The presence of multiple subdomains with similar vulnerabilities suggests a systemic issue in domain management practices.

4. **Educate Development and Operations Teams** — Conduct training sessions on the importance of domain security and the risks associated with GitHub takeovers. — **Evidence:** Awareness can help prevent future misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

5. **Monitor for Future Vulnerabilities** — Set up continuous monitoring for similar vulnerabilities across all subdomains to ensure timely detection and response. — **Evidence:** Ongoing vigilance is necessary to protect against evolving threats.
