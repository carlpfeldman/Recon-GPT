# Action Plan (Prioritized)
1. **Mitigate GitHub Takeover Risk** — Multiple subdomains of HackerOne are vulnerable to GitHub takeover, which could allow an attacker to claim the domain and impersonate the service. — Evidence: Detected on `https://mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com`, `https://mta-sts.hackerone.com`, and `https://mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com` with extracted results indicating potential takeover targets (e.g., `hacker0x01.github.io`).

   - **Next Steps**: 
     - Verify ownership of the GitHub repositories associated with these subdomains.
     - Ensure that the DNS records are correctly configured to prevent unauthorized access.
     - Consider implementing a WAF rule to block requests to these subdomains if they do not point to valid content.

# Vulnerability Summary
- **GitHub Takeover** — `mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com`, `mta-sts.hackerone.com`, `mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com` — `github-takeover` — High Severity

   - **Details**: The detected subdomains return a 404 error, indicating that they are not properly configured. This presents a risk of takeover by malicious actors who could register the GitHub pages and impersonate the legitimate service.
