# Action Plan (Prioritized)
1. **Mitigate GitHub Takeover Risk** — **High Severity** — Multiple hosts (e.g., `https://mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com`, `https://mta-sts.hackerone.com`, `https://mta-sts.managed.hackerone.com`) are vulnerable to GitHub takeover due to missing or misconfigured DNS records. This allows an attacker to potentially take control of the GitHub pages associated with these domains. 
   - **Next Steps**: 
     - Verify DNS records for the affected domains to ensure they point to the correct GitHub Pages.
     - Implement a proper CNAME record pointing to the intended GitHub repository.
     - Review and update any relevant configurations to prevent unauthorized access.
