### High-Level Assessment
The target, www.ifood.com.br, is active with a single resolved host and subdomain. However, the attack surface appears limited, as there are no discovered URLs or HTTP probe results indicating additional endpoints or services. The confidence in the findings is moderate due to the lack of comprehensive data, which suggests that further reconnaissance is necessary to fully understand the security posture of the target.

### Action Plan
1. **Expand Reconnaissance**: 
   - Utilize tools like Sublist3r or Amass to discover additional subdomains and endpoints associated with ifood.com.br. This could reveal hidden services or APIs that may be vulnerable.
   - Example: Run a subdomain enumeration tool to check for variations such as api.ifood.com.br or other potential subdomains.

2. **Perform Active Scanning**:
   - Conduct an active scan using tools like Nmap to identify open ports and services running on www.ifood.com.br. This will help in understanding the underlying infrastructure and potential entry points.
   - Example: Run a command like `nmap -sV www.ifood.com.br` to gather service version information.

3. **Web Application Testing**:
   - If any URLs are discovered in future scans, perform web application security testing using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to identify common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, or CSRF.
   - Example: Once URLs are identified, target them with automated scans to check for vulnerabilities.

4. **Monitor for Changes**:
   - Set up monitoring for changes in the target's DNS records and web content. This can help in identifying new subdomains or services that may be introduced over time.
   - Example: Use services like SecurityTrails or DNSDumpster for ongoing monitoring.

### Recon Summary
- **Subdomains**: 1 (www.ifood.com.br)
- **Resolved Hosts**: 1 (www.ifood.com.br)
- **Discovered URLs**: 0
- **HTTP Probe Results**: 0
- **Nuclei Findings**: 0

**Notable Gaps**: 
- No discovered URLs indicate a lack of visible web application endpoints.
- No HTTP probe results suggest that there may be no active services or that they are not responding to standard probes.
- No subdomains other than the main domain were identified, indicating a potentially limited attack surface.

**Vulnerability Findings**: No known vulnerabilities detected in this run.
